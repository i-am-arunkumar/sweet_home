# SCRIPTING
# You can specify a script that gets run when the rule matches by
# setting the "script" option.

#   script appname summary body icon urgency
# where urgency can be "LOW", "NORMAL" or "CRITICAL".
#
# NOTE: if you don't want a notification to be displayed, set the format
# to "".
# NOTE: It might be helpful to run dunst -print in a terminal in order
# to find fitting options for rules.

# fullscreen values
# show: show the notifications, regardless if there is a fullscreen window opened
# delay: displays the new notification, if there is no fullscreen window active
#        If the notification is already drawn, it won't get undrawn.

#           withdrawn from screen again and will get delayed like a new notification
